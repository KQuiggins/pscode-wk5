// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers
add the 2 number together
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Define a range of numbers to check

Loop through the range of numbers

if num modulo 2 is equal to 0 then
    print "The number is even"
else
    print "The number is odd"
end if

// Exercise 3:
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.

ask for 5 numbers
add the 5 numbers together
divide the sum by 5
print the average of the 5 numbers

c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.

loop through the 5 numbers
set the first number as the minimum and maximum
if the number is less than the current minimum then
    set the minimum to the current number
end if
if the number is greater than the current maximum then
    set the maximum to the current number


d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

print the average of the 5 numbers
print the minimum of the 5 numbers
print the maximum of the 5 numbers
